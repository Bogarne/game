React JS Game App
===========

### DEMO
https://game.gyper.fun/

### Locally 
1. Clone down the theme's repository (`git clone https://github.com/Bogarne/game.git`)
2. `cd` into the theme's directory
3. Run `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `yarn start` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to preview the theme

### Deployment
`yarn build` creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`
